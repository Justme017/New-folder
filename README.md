# Student-Only AI/Cloud Benefits (Last verified: 2026-02-08)

Curated, student-only offers for AI assistants, LLM APIs, GPU/notebooks, cloud credits, and dev tools. Focus: requires student verification (email/SheerID/GitHub Student Pack/ISIC). No general free tiers.

## How to use
- Check eligibility and geography; verify with academic email or GitHub Student Pack before planning spend.
- Note duration type (renewable, fixed-term, or credit-based) and what happens after expiry.
- Mind payment requirements (some need a card for overages) and service limits (regions, rate limits, GPU hours).
- Redeem only via official links below; avoid third-party coupon/blog claims.

## Scope rules
- Student-only benefits; excludes ordinary free tiers unless extra student value exists.
- Categories: AI assistants, LLM APIs, GPU/notebooks, cloud/hosting, dev tools for AI/ML, learning/certifications.
