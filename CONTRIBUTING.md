## ✅ What to Include

- Only **student-only offers** (requires verification such as academic email, SheerID, ISIC, or GitHub Student Pack). Do not add general free tiers.
- Focus areas: AI/LLM assistants, LLM APIs, GPU/notebooks, cloud/hosting credits, dev tools, security, domains, and student-only learning/certifications.
- Include: geography, eligibility, verification method, duration type, requirements (card? email?), key limits, and **official links**.

## 🔍 Verification Requirements

- Use **official sources only** (vendor site, official docs/FAQ, or official blog). No third-party blogs or coupons.
- Record "Last verified" as the date you checked the official source.
- If anything is uncertain, place it under **Unverified / Needs Confirmation** with a note on what is missing.

## ⏱️ Duration Classification

| Type | Meaning |
|:-----|:--------|
| 🔄 Renewable | Requires periodic re-verification while enrolled |
| ⏳ Fixed-term | Specific duration (e.g., 3/6/12/24 months) |
| 💰 Credit-based | Set amount + expiry date |

## 📝 How to Format a New Entry

Copy this template and fill in each column:

```markdown
| **Tool Name** | Benefit description | ⏳ Duration | 🎓 Verification | Requirements | Key limits | [🔗](https://official-link.com) |
```

**Example:**

```markdown
| **Cursor Pro** | ⏳ Free Cursor Pro for **1 year** — AI code editor | ⏳ 1 year | 🛡️ SheerID + .edu email | Student email | Advanced models included | [🔗](https://www.cursor.com/students) |
```

## ✏️ How to Update an Existing Entry

1. Edit the relevant table row in `README.md`, keeping columns aligned.
2. Update "Last verified" with today's date when you confirm details from the official source.
3. For removals, explain briefly in the changelog section.
4. For new offers, add to the correct category table and include an official link. If proof is incomplete, add to the Unverified section instead.

## 🎯 Quality Bar

- Be **concise and factual** — avoid marketing language.
- Include **key limitations** (rate limits, region availability, non-commercial clauses, excluded services).
- Note **payment requirements** (card needed for signup or overages).
- Use the correct **emoji symbols** from the Legend in the README.

## 📋 Changelog Practice

- Append a brief dated note to `README.md` under **Changelog** for any substantive update (add/remove/change/verify).

---

## ❌ What NOT to Submit

- General free tiers that don't require student verification
- Affiliate links or referral codes
- Unverified claims from blogs/YouTube/Reddit
- Duplicate entries already in the list
- Tools with no official student program page
