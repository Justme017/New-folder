# Contributing

Thanks for helping keep this student-only benefit list accurate. Please follow these rules so entries stay trustworthy and current.

## What to include
- Only student-only offers (requires verification such as academic email, SheerID, ISIC, or GitHub Student Pack). Do not add general free tiers.
- Focus areas: AI/LLM assistants, LLM APIs, GPU/notebooks, cloud/hosting credits, dev tools for AI/ML, and student-only learning/certifications.
- Add geography, eligibility, verification method, duration type, requirements (card? email?), key limits, and official links.

## Verification requirements
- Use official sources only (vendor site, official docs/FAQ, or official blog). No third-party blogs or coupons.
- Record “Last verified” as the date you checked the official source.
- If anything is uncertain, place it under "Unverified / needs confirmation" with a note on what is missing.

## Duration classification
- True lifetime free (explicitly stated) — rare.
- Renewable while student (requires periodic re-verification).
- Fixed-term free (e.g., 3/6/12/24 months).
- Credit-based (amount + expiry).

## How to update
1. Edit the relevant table row in README.md, keeping columns aligned.
2. Update "Last verified" with today’s date when you confirm details from the official source.
3. For removals, explain briefly in the changelog section.
4. For new offers, add to the correct geography/category table and include an official link. If proof is incomplete, add to the Unverified section instead.

## Quality bar
- Be concise and factual; avoid marketing language.
- Include key limitations (rate limits, region availability, non-commercial clauses, excluded services).
- Note payment requirements (card needed for signup or overages).

## Changelog practice
- Append a brief dated note to README.md under "Changelog" for any substantive update (add/remove/change/verify).
